Assignment:
The student registration system will display the list of courses available for registration.  The program should show current registration numbers and available seats for each course.  After a student successfully registers, the registration information should be stored in a file.
The system should provide several features: 

•	The ability for students to view an alphabetical list of courses that includes the course identification number, course dates, name, brief summary, the enrollment limit, and the number of students already enrolled. 
•	The ability for students to register or un-register for a course.
•	The ability for a student to see a list of classes for which he/she is currently registered. 
There are several business rules:

•	The system should not allow a student to register for a full course.
•	The system should not allow one student to view the registration information for another student.
•	The system should not allow a student to un-register from a course for which he/she is not registered.


Build:
Run build.bat

Execute:
Run run.bat

Basic usage:
The students.csv file contains the list of authorized users. Username: jdoe and password:~tstmE1 is one user which will allow entry into the system. 
Alternatively, a new user can be setup by selecting '2' at the login screen (lots of questions asked!!!).
